You're my fren now, let's eat soft tacos later! Being silly aside though The Filmmaking process is split into Three phases, The Pre-Production phase, Production , and Post-Production phases Don't worry about those complicated seeming words though, it's actually much simpler than you might think The Pre-Production phase This phase is about making a plan or a script for your film! It probably sounds hard but if you really think about it, for a simple film all you really need is a little plan It can be as simple as Introduction(preferably visual) Conflict Resolution You can also play around with those 3 steps, like repeating them and chaining them together, like after the resolution another conflict arises, similar to how when you fix a bug, 10 more bugs appear in your game :p There are various things you can play around with in the pre-production phase of the film, but it's mainly just writing, and if you really want to be thourough about it, then try storyboarding. (optional) Storyboarding really involves you already knowing how to do visuals with your camera, so if you're new don't even think too much about this one, move onto the next point but for those who already have made a film or 2, then take those visuals you have in your head and make a simple stick figure or a shape, signifying the shot/scene for you don't forget to put descriptions for the scene, cause you might need to explain your storyboarding to others, if you're gonna work with others. Now time for the Production Phase! The production phase is split into 4 parts: Picking Worlds Preparing your shots Planning out film sessions(if the scene requires more than 1 person) Executing them Picking Worlds This is pretty straightforward, with the things you have planned, just find a world that fits the criteria of the scenes you wanna shoot, or make your own world Prepare your shots This one requires you to know the basics of cinematography, but the main thing you gotta know is that the VRChat camera grid(the option on the veeeery right of the VRChat camera) is your best friend However if you wanna be a little bit more thorough, then try looking into the shot sizes and camera movement types in film Plan out your Film Sessions If your film is really short and requires a really small amount of shots with people, then go to publics and/or your friends and ask them in your film session(best if you remind them an hour before though) But if it requires more than 2 shots, then follow these 3 steps Plan it out. Plan your film sessions for Late Friday and Late Saturday EST. (optional) Make a discord server or a group chat. Find people. Go to publics and/or your friends and ask them to be in your film session, tell them when, and if you have done point 2, then invite them to your discord/group chat with the message on when the film session is, posted in there. Execute the Film Session Now that everything is planned out, when the film session starts, load up OBS , invite your people, and start the film session! also a little tip, if you asked your friends, see if you can get them to record their voicelines in audacity while they are in the film session. It could help you get better control of your audio during post-production. if you won't do that and your film needs voice lines, you will need to find people to record some voice lines for you. Post-Production Phase Here you gather up all your shots, go over to Davinci Resolve , CapCut or Kdenlive and Start Editing your Film! I recommend using Davinci Resolve as it has all of the tools you need for Post-Production in Film! Post-Production is split into 5 parts Selection of shots Editing Sound design VFX and Subtitling Selection of Shots This is pretty straightforward, just look over to the shots that you've filmed and pick the ones that fit the most with your film and feel the best. Editing Editing is the act of putting the clips together, so everything would feel seamless and the pacing would be perfect(to you of course) In editing make sure to follow your gut, as well as the audio waveform if you already picked a soundtrack or you already have voice clips Sound Design Sound Design is the act of gathering sfx, music and voice clips and making the best thing you can out of those three You can use Davinci Resolve for it, or go to a DAW(like Reaper) to use external tools, plugins and VST's to achieve the best thing you can with sound Sound Design is so cool...ahem VFX VFX is the act of making cool effects happen on your screen to enhance the film you're watching, VFX can include stuff like portals, fireballs or simple visuals like VHS style effects and the like. You can look up some cool VFX tutorials on YouTube but I recommend looking at channels like Subtitling This is the last thing you will do in a film, it's basically the transcribing what the characters say on screen and/or putting text in the film. After you're done with pre-production, production and post-production, you are ready to publish your film! Make sure to title it as something and share it around with your friends, SN0W \uff1c\uff1e\uff1c and The \uff1c\uff1e\uff1c community ! If your film is meant to be submitted for CRYSTALL1ZED \uff1c\uff1e\uff1c , then head over to The SN0W \uff1c\uff1e\uff1c Discord Server and submit your film at the CRYSTALL1ZED contributions channel!

Editing Editing is the act of putting the clips together, so everything would feel seamless and the pacing would be perfect(to you of course) In editing make sure to follow your gut, as well as the audio waveform if you already picked a soundtrack or you already have voice clips Sound Design Sound Design is the act of gathering sfx, music and voice clips and making the best thing you can out of those three You can use Davinci Resolve for it, or go to a DAW(like Reaper) to use external tools, plugins and VST's to achieve the best thing you can with sound Sound Design is so cool...ahem VFX VFX is the act of making cool effects happen on your screen to enhance the film you're watching, VFX can include stuff like portals, fireballs or simple visuals like VHS style effects and the like. You can look up some cool VFX tutorials on YouTube but I recommend looking at channels like Subtitling This is the last thing you will do in a film, it's basically the transcribing what the characters say on screen and/or putting text in the film. After you're done with pre-production, production and post-production, you are ready to publish your film! Make sure to title it as something and share it around with your friends, SN0W \uff1c\uff1e\uff1c and The \uff1c\uff1e\uff1c community !

Also because we are in the Prototyping Stage, if your plan for your world is for it to be a game world, then I recommend making a simple prototype/sketch of what will be the gameplay in your game world(remember, keep it simple). So If you don't know jack shit about first time setup then go over to The Official VRChat Documentation , vrc.school , or find a YouTube tutorial to help you out with that (please don't fall into the tutorial hell before you even get started...please) After you're done making your sketch It's time for the Modeling Stage You could choose one of the 3 options from now on: continue building with ProBuilder using external assets for your project or build the models for your world in Blender If you want a little push when it comes to modeling, there's a more in depth tutorial for pro-builder For external assets you can go to booth , the Unity Asset Store , or the 3d models channel in The\uff1c\uff1e\uff1c community Discord Server , get some models and drag and drop them into your unity project As for blender...god bless you Next up, we have the Texturing Stage to be honest it's very much tied to the Modeling Stage, but I want to give it a separate stage For Texturing I recommend using GIMP , or Affinity I recommend playing around with textures and the photo editing software as it can be fun to play around in it(so much so that you'll lose track of time lmao) But keep in mind your original idea for a texture(or you'll get off track) Next up we have the Programming Stage Here you are split between 2 paths, the Path of Udon Graph , or the Path of UdonSharp The difference is literally about if you prefer visual programming or traditional programming Though the differences also are about support, what I mean is Udon Graph from my experience has a little bit less support, due to the simple fact that developers nowadays work with AI when it comes to programming, and it's much harder to work with code if it is visual over textual. So if you're planning to use the assistance of ChatGPT or Claude, It's a better idea to go for UdonSharp Though I personally think that it's always a good idea to know how your code works exactly or close to exactly even if you're coding with the assistance of AI So please, make sure to check documentations, look at blogs, look at discord servers for solutions and always ask your AI, how does the code work? I promise this will take you leaps and bounds further compared to if you didn't do that. As for what you can make in the world when it comes to programming, for starters, how about a toggleable mirror? Now once you're done with programming you can move onto the optional stage of world dev! (optional) \"Adding the cool stuff you like into your world\" Stage! you can do so by searching around booth , or any other marketplace orrr by going over to The \uff1c\uff1e\uff1c community Discord Server Above: VISUAL ON THE WORLD PREFABS CHANNEL clicking on the world prefabs channel, downloading some cool stuff the \uff1c\uff1e\uff1c community has made, and dropping them into your world! Now, once you've done with programming and adding the things you want into your world, we're gonna move onto the Testing and Optimizing Stage In this stage make sure to test everything thoroughly, and under 10x the conditions to make sure that your world doesn't lag on older hardware or phones. For example let's say you have an enemy AI in your world with a complicated script for it. Try spawning a 1000 or 2000 of them into your world(this is an over exaggeration but you can do this to test extreme situations), if your world lags then see how you can optimize your code or the world itself A couple things you can do in your world is Turn all of the objects that you know wont move, static Enable Occlusion Culling Reduce the size of your textures(the default is 2048), if you want your texture to be pixelated over being blurry like a youtube video, then change the filter mode from Bilinear to Point(no filter) And lastly, the Lightning Stage! There are 2 routes that you can take with the Lighting Stage: The Bakery Route , or the Unity Lighting System Route The Lighting Route doesn't take too long to finish as you need to only configure a couple stuff then let your pc bake the lights. Though it will take longer if you're particular about the kind of lighting you want to have. And with that You are finished with the world! Just upload your world and see how it looks! if it looks good, publish it to community labs and share it around with your friends, SNOW \uff1c\uff1e\uff1c , and The \uff1c\uff1e\uff1c community !
