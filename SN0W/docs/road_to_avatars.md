## So you want to make an avatar, right?
aight bet

First things first, **choose your theme**

doesn't have to be anything grand, I mean if you've seen cunks_feet's avatars, they're literally chosen on a whim, so yeah just pick one.

&nbsp;

Second things second, **find a base** 

just go on [BOOTH](https://booth.pm/) and find a base that you like

Or alternatively use an **Unk**(a free avatar base that cunks_feet made himself) by going over to the [**CHEESE ＜＞＜ discord server**](https://discord.gg/xf4qvPYe7Z) and then asking [cunks_feet](https://vrchat.com/home/user/usr_78aad47e-8f05-4abd-92bf-698d468ad561) in [**DAILY VRCHAT**](https://www.theziver.com/daily.html) for an **Unk**. Don't worry too much about asking him about this, he won't mind.

&nbsp;

Third things third, **start up Unity via [ALCOM](https://vrc-get.anatawa12.com/alcom) or [VCC](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com), load up a base into the project and start working on it**

I believe that improvisation is key when it comes to tackling projects. I mean some planning is of course necessary but we already did that with the previous 2 steps.

and **yes**, that amount of planning is perfectly fine, just something that gets you off the ground and running, **that's all you need**

&nbsp;

Of course if you don't know how to install unity and do the bare basics, there are other tutorials and documentations out there!

Try the [official VRChat documentation](https://creators.vrchat.com/avatars/creating-your-first-avatar), [vrc.school](https://vrc.school), or just finding a tutorial on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSwMz4WcajQ&list=PLt8qiEFqNHFkPqpKLnVRx-G78mGvjPbFt&index=1)

Also the documentations above will help you in the journey of making your avatar, so don't forget to check them out if you are struggling with something!
