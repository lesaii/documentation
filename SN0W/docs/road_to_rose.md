Make your contribution concise and presentable. A good presentation, especially a video, is the best way to win votes.

Contributions that contain NSFW content are not allowed.

&nbsp;

After submitting a contribution it will be reviewed by TheZiver and decided If a vote is necessary, if so all the rose fish members will participate in a 2-day long voting process. To receive a rose fish invitation‚ the contribution must receive a **YES** vote from over **60％** of the voting rose fish members․

Deciding if a vote is necessary TheZiver will consider these things:

- **Fun:** Is it fun?
- **Presentability:** Is the contribution well presented and easy to understand?
- **Effort:** How much human effort was needed to make this? How much did AI help?
- **Usability:** Can it be used for something?
- **Originality:** How different is the contribution from previous contributions?
- **Collaboration:** How many people were involved in creating the contribution?
